# Ravenous project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project allows to connect and search the Yelp data on restaurants. the app is using Yelp Fusion API. The Yelp Fusion API allows you to get the best local content and user reviews from millions of businesses around the world

Input fields allow for search by name of business or cuisine for example (in the left input field).
The right input field allows for adding a location parameter.

The current active setup is using the sample data to show the look of the app.

As API key will not be shared, sample data is still in use.
In order to restore full usage, api key should be added in the Utils.js and lines 6,7,37,38,41,42 and 43 of the App.js modified as instructed at the end of those lines.

Have fun!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build` Should not be used as the project has CORS Restrictions

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
